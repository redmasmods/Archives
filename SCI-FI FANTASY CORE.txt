
SCI-FI FANTASY CORE is a game overhaul for No Man’s Sky changing gameplay, adding new gameplay mechanics, 
improving visuals, planets terrain, flora, fauna, adding diversity,  buildings and custom new props. 
Most of the changes are not visible for vanilla players, but you can instance a game with them still.
 The Alpha Vector bonus ship given by the mod is visible by vanilla players and will stay in your save after the mod removal. 
This mod can be switch to vanilla as often as you want. The mod is compatible with any mods as long as their filename starts by an underscore.

Note For modders :
"SCI FI fantasy core" aims to be a base layer for modding, and that is easy to maintain ( quickly updatable  ).
The inhibitors ( quicly updatable , 100% made of vanilla files ), responds to ppl wishes, but it is also a start for furthers mods.
 I gave a detailed description of them so that, ppl take the inhibitors and tweak them to create their own mods, that will tweak the core.
 Its also an interresting and easy way to learn modding for newbies.
 Since inhibitors description give info on what the vanilla gamefiles are changing, and with some advices on what they do to the game.

- Cameras overhaul: all cameras have larger FOV, Camera will place more far or on shoulder depending on situations. ( like while mining on vehicles ) The camera will not shake unless massive scale events happen ( nearby Sand-worms or volcanic eruptions )  The spaceship is not visible while warping between 2 systems.
Exocrafts controls rework so that they are an efficient way to travel on planet surface. ( able to climb montains and fast travelling. Each exocrafts have its own advantages. ) It is recommanded to install a boost update on every vehicles. + Mech perform 360 turns fast.
 
- Sentinels combat improvements: Sentinels are more dodgy, they will hide from player sight, their attacks are more powerful and short. Combat escalade faster.  The walker will act like a boss and will use a machinegun as a final attack when his life is low. It’s  attack is very powerful but still dodgable if you focus it. Dogs act like snipers, and drones wil take high sky to locate your position.
 
- Player’s onfoot movements are improved: Turns are faster, jetpack is more controlable in air and can be use as a way to travel. Rocket boots do a bigger jump that allows to take off for flying or to get out of caves. Player swims faster, and jetpack under water is more efficient. The player walk by default, you will have to use the sprint action in order to run ( or use the jetpack ). Player is not slowed down while using multi-tool shield ( for more dynamic combats )
